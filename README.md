# ZK-IA: Feasible image authentication scheme for content integrity using ZK

### :pencil: Abstract
The manipulation of digital images has become a significant challenge in maintaining information integrity in the digital age. Traditional methods of ensuring image integrity often fall short due to their limitations in handling permissible image transformations or vulnerabilities to adversaries. This research aim to proposes a novel approach using Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology to provide a robust, secure, and efficient method of proving image integrity. Our goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by developing a web application or browser plugins that support functionalities like ZKP proof generation and verification for images.


### :triangular_flag_on_post: Goals
Explore a reliable and feasible method for authenticating digital images, even if they are generated by AI, using ZKP. Specifically, achieve image integrity where the redactions made by the owner are undeniable and traceable. Moreover, if any area has been legally edited, we want to attain area zero-knowledge, and it should be impossible to infer any information about the modified part from the proofs and post-processed image. Objectives are listed as below,

- Develop a PoC image authentication protocol where the performance is optimized among current protocols.
- Build a web application or browser plugin to demonstrate the simple use case of this protocol.
- Ensure the system supports basic permissible image transformations such as grayscale, cropping, and resizing without compromising integrity.


### :hammer: Working Status
Idea: In the first round of study, I've read through all the papers cited in references. It occurs to me that [image post-processing circuits](https://github.com/TrishaDatta/circom-circuits/tree/main) such as grayscaling, resizing, and cropping contain a few similar constraints that might be able to improve using recursive SNARK.
Next step:
1. Compile image post-processing circuits into Nova prover by [Nova Scotia](https://github.com/nalinbhardwaj/Nova-Scotia).
2. Run [Nova](https://github.com/microsoft/Nova) and test the performances with the benchmarks in the papers. Construct a comparison table among existed protocols.
3. Study on the choices of hash function. I will continue the study on which combinations of them (e.g. Poseidon Hash + Lattice Hash) best fit the recursive SNARK.
