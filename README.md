# Feasible Image Authentication Scheme for Content Integrity

### :pencil: Abstract
The manipulation of digital images has become a significant challenge in maintaining information integrity in the digital age. Traditional methods of ensuring image integrity often fall short due to their limitations in handling permissible image transformations or vulnerabilities to adversaries. This research aim to proposes a novel approach using Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology to provide a robust, secure, and efficient method of proving image integrity. Our goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by developing a web application or browser plugins that support functionalities like ZKP proof generation and verification for images.


### :triangular_flag_on_post: Goals
**Primary Goal**: To establish a reliable and feasible method for authenticating digital images (even its generated by AI) using Zero-Knowledge Proof technology, thereby contributing to the fight against disinformation.

**Secondary Goals**
- Develop a user-friendly web application or browser plugin for demo.
- Ensure the system supports various permissible image transformations such as grayscale, cropping, and resizing without compromising integrity.
- Provide a public-proving and public-verifying authentication system that is secure and reliable.

### :hammer: Working Status
Idea: In the first round of study, I've read through all the papers cited in references. It occurs to me that [image post-processing circuits](https://github.com/TrishaDatta/circom-circuits/tree/main) such as grayscaling, resizing, and cropping contain a few similar constraints that might be able to improve using recursive SNARK. My next step is to try using [Nova](https://github.com/microsoft/Nova) and compare it with the benchmarks in the papers. Moreover, the choices of hash function can be another aspect to optimize. I will continue the study on which combinations of them (e.g. Poseidon Hash + Lattice Hash) best fit the recursive SNARK.
